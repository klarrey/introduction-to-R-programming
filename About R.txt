The advantages of object orientation can be explained by example. Consider
statistical regression. When you perform a regression analysis with
other statistical packages, such as SAS or SPSS, you get a mountain of output
on the screen. By contrast, if you call the lm() regression function in
R, the function returns an object containing all the resultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âthe estimated
coefficients, their standard errors, residuals, and so on. You then pick and
choose, programmatically, which parts of that object to extract.
